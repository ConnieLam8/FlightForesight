# Machine Learning Prediction Model: FlightForesight

Airplane delays compromise a significant number of flights annually, negatively impacting 
passengers. We aim to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting flight 
delays. This predictive tool will be made accessible to customers, helping them make more 
informed decisions when planning their travel.
